# console-finances

Description

This objective of this project is to create an application for analysing the financial records of a company.

I applied a lot of the knowledge that I learnt from from instructors to tackle this project, for example, how to use the 'for loop' and 'console.log'. 

It was challenging, seperating the strings from the numbers in the datasets and being able to get the total sum of the profits and losses. The instructors were helpful in giving hints on how to seperate them.

I appreciate all their efforts.
